# LiteGlass-v2

This  is graphical clock that also displays the weather and date. It is a port of my initial LiteGlass project from Python into HTML. I ported from Python because the Tkinter library was too constraining with UI spacing and did not allow for custom fonts.

I also added functionality for an "alarm clock" feature. It displays a QR code which I can scan every morning to turn off my alarm.
